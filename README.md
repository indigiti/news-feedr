## Notes

* AngularJS version 1.5.8

* A few different web tutorials were consulted and code models were followed.

* The Google Feed API was taken down in December 2016, so I have replaced it
with this RSS to JSON converter [Link](https://rss2json.com).

Any feedback or comments would be appreciated.
